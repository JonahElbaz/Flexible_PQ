Flexible Priority Queue - COMP 352 Assignment 3
 your  task is to implement your own flexible priority queue ADT using both min- and max-heap in Java. The 
specifications of the flexible priority queue are provided in the following. The  heap(s) must  be  implemented from 
scratch using an array that is automatically extendable.  You  are  not allowed  to  use  any list (including  arraylist), 
tree, vector,  or  heap implementation already  available  in  Java.  You  must  not duplicate  code  for  implementing  min
- and max-heaps
(i.e. the  same  code  must be  used  for  constructing  min  or  max  heaps. Hence  think  of  a flexible  way  to  parameterize  your  code  for  either  min- or  max  heap).
